## How to install TypeScript:

1. Open your commend line and type a commend that will install the type Script globally.
        npm install -g typescript
        // Then you can make a file and work on it

2. To run any commend we have to write (tsc) first and this is a syntex.

3. To check you'r depandanci is install we have this commend and it will show you'r downloaded version in you file.
        tsc -v


## Convert in JS:

1. we can't see the result/output in the typeScript.We have to convert it in a javaScript and then we have to see the output of our code.The commend of converting typeScript to javaScript is:
        tsc TS_File_Name
